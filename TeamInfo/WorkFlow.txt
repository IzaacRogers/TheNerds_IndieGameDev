Game Design is a very complicated, mulit-layered, precess.
To make things easier, I have created these guidelines to follow, through the process of development

PreProduction:
	Come up with an idea
		~not too detailed
		~not too big
	Develop the idea
		~write your idea
		~slowly add stuff to your idea which i directly related to the idea



Production:
	"Meshing"
		Art:
			all art should be functional art only
			level design should not be too fancy (there will be time for refinement later)
		Code:
			get the most important code done first
			tackel each problem in steps
			dont do too much "FutureProofing"
	"Bulk"
		Art:
			start to add textures, materials, and "life" to the level design
			add "large" detail
			rough animations
			create needed models
		Code:
			improve functionality and usefullness
			work on smaller "detail" code
			work on large bugs
	"Lighting"
		Art:
			this is when you go through and add in all the detail
			smooth out all the kinks in the art
			finalize models, textrues, and materials
			add in proper lighting
			any other fine tuning needed
		Code:
			work on the "Art" code
				(code that does not directly effect the mechanics, but adds to the over all emersion)
		Sound:
			add in the sound effects and start woking on music

	"Refinement"
		Art:
			Any small tweaks that need to be added
			any refinements needed
		Code:
			work out the bugs
			optomization (if any)
		Sound:
			refinement
